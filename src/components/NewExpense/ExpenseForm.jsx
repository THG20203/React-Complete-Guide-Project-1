  pieces per component - BUT ITS BETTER -> to use one state - and use an OBJECT as a value. In this

    occured -> in which cause the input. The input in turn has a long list of properties we can read
    and set -> the 'value' property (holds the current value of the input at the point this event
    occurs). This means we can drill into this target and then the value, to get the value which 
    was currently entered when the event occured for the element we're listening. */
