/* Chart bar fill div = required to remember by how much this chart bar will be filled. */
/* one piece of information missing in this css class = height of this filled bar chart. 
Overall chart bar has a pre defined height (10rem), BUT how much we fill bar depends on the
data we're recieving. i.e. depends on value prop from Chart.jsx. want to fill chart bar by putting 
the value in relation to the max value. */
/* If max value fro the entire chart is 100 and the value for a given chart bar is 50, we fill 
that chart bar by 50%. So in chart bar component */

/* We need to calculate by how much specific chart bar instance should be filled. */
