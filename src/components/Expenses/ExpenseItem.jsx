/* React is the default import, we need specifically named things from the react library -
i.e. a function called useState */

///// IMPORTANT USESTATE DEFINITION
/* useState = function provided by the React library, allows us to define values as state
where changes to these values should reflect in the component function being called again */

import React, { useState } from "react";
/* need to import ExpenseDate - our second custom component cause we're splitting components */
import ExpenseDate from "./ExpenseDate";

/* need pre defined styles from our Card component */
/* Go up one level in folder with .. and then into UI folder */
import Card from "../UI/Card";

/* make overall build process aware of css file, tell it css code should be considered */
import "./ExpenseItem.css";

/* JavasScript code */

/* Inside of ExpenseItem.jsx - we need to do something with the recieved attribute values */

/* How do we get access to the values defined in the place where we use our custom components? 
The answer is parameters */

// SUPER IMPORTANT PROPS EXPLANATION
/* We get one parameter - react ensures this. This is an object which holds all the recieved 
attributes as properties, hence the name props */

/* Props hold all the values we get for the attributes on our custom element We get key value
pairs in our props object. */

/* We've replaced our <div> with our custom card component (see the Card element we are returning 
  with the class of expense-item */

const ExpenseItem = (props) => {
  /* move the logic out of the JSX code which we are attempting to keep as lean as possible, 
  don't want logic within it */

  // USE STATE SPECIFIC THEORY
  /* useState is a hook to utilise -> MUST ONLY BE CALLED INSIDE REACT FUNCTIONS */

  /* useState registers some state (some value as a state) for the component in which it is being 
  called. Go even more precise -> it registers it for a specific component instance */

  /* useState wants a default/initial state value (props.title) because we create a special 
  variable, where changes will need this function to be called again */

  /* useState returns an array, first value is the variable itself, second is the updated
  function */

  /* array destructing utilised, to store both elements in seperate variables or consts */

  /* convention is call the first variable whatever you want, second set then the name 
  of the first variable  */

  const [title, setTitle] = useState(props.title);

  /* In addition, whenever state changes because we click a button in this case, its only
  this component function (expenseItem) and only that specific instance of where this component
  is being used, where react will re-evaluate it, so will be called 4 times if we use ExpenseItem 
  as component four times in Expenses as we are */

  const clickHandler = () => {
    setTitle("Updated!");
  };
  return (
    <Card className="expense-item">

      prop */}
