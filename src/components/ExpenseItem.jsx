/* Inside of ExpenseItem.jsx - we need to do something with the recieved attribute values */

/* How do we get access to the values defined in the place where we use our custom components? 
The answer is parameters */

// SUPER IMPORTANT PROPS EXPLANATION
/* We get one parameter - react ensures this. This is an object which holds all the recieved 
attributes as properties, hence the name props */

/* Props hold all the values we get for the attributes on our custom element We get key value
pairs in our props object. */

function ExpenseItem(props) {
  /* Output value dynamically and acces props.date. How can we output the month? We can use a built
  in method - accessible on all date objects in JavaScript - toLocaleString. This toLocaleString 
  method helps output dates in human readable formats. */

  /* Passing in two arguments to toLocaleString, first is the language, second is an object where
  you configure how specifically that they should be formatted */

  /* better to NOT add normal JavaScript into JSX code, but to create a seperate helper variable. 
  Something like month, which is a seperate helper const that simply holds that value. */

  /* Why put logic up here? Keep JSX code lean, more complex logic is rest of function. JSX = easier 
  to read */

  const month = props.date.toLocaleString("en-GB", { month: "long" });
  /* same as above for day but we want it in a 2-digit format */
  const day = props.date.toLocaleString("en-GB", { day: "2-digit" });
  /* for year - access getFullYear -> which is another built-in which just extracts
  the year as a four digit number */
